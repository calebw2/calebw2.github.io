# Random Forest Regression for the Manufacturing of Industrial Lubricating Grease


For the manufacturing of lubricating grease, one of the most important specifications is the consistency of the grease. Often for the manufacturer this is a difficult task, as the outcome does not always follow a logical progression, and often much time is wasted on incremental adjustments to achieve the desired consistency. The goal of this model is to assist the manufacturer in efficiency by predicting the approximate amount of base oil needed to meet specifications.

## Overview of Manufacturing Grease
Grease is defined as a lubricant suspended in some thickener. This thickener is most often a soap, the metallic salt of a fatty acid. There are several types of thickeners and complexing agents used for this. The general method for manufacture is as follows: 
1.	A “base grease” is cooked in a reactor by heating base oil, dissolving a fatty acid, adding a metallic base (i.e. lithium hydroxide), and heating until the reaction is complete
2.	The base grease is transferred to a finishing kettle where it receives its additives. The additive package is different for every grease according to its needs
3.	The consistency is tested, and the grease is then “oiled back” by adding more base oil, causing the grease to thin out. This step is done incrementally until the desired consistency is reached.
4.	The grease is filled into its packaging and shipped.

## The Problem
Through this relatively simple process, one usually reaches the conclusion that more oil yields a softer grease. While this is generally true, it isn't easy to reliably estimate how much oil will end up being needed to achieve the desired consistency. Not every grease type reacts the same, and sometimes even the same grease will react differently. With much hands-on experience, the technician can sort of “get a feel” for it, but this requires a lot of commitment that is fairly unreasonable for most people in this position to put in given their compensation. As the firm grows and more people are involved this becomes even more true.



## How does this website work?

First, check out the Github repository for this site: [https://github.com/atmosalex/atmosalex.github.io/](https://github.com/atmosalex/atmosalex.github.io/).

Using GitHub pages, you can write a website using markdown syntax - the same syntax we use to write comments in Google Colab notebooks. GitHub pages then takes the markdown file and renders it as a web page using a Jekyll theme. The markdown source code for this page [is shown here](https://github.com/atmosalex/atmosalex.github.io/blob/main/README.md?plain=1).

## Setting up your Project Website

### How to copy this site as a template
1. Create [a GitHub account](https://github.com/)
2.	Create a new GitHub repository with the name **username.github.io**, where **username** is your GitHub username as shown below. Select *public* and do not tick *Add a README file*. [![screenshot][1]][1]
3.	From your new repository, you should see a *Quick setup* guide. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click *Import code*, as shown: [![screenshot][2]][2]
4.	In the box that says *Your old repository’s clone URL*, copy and paste this URL: `https://github.com/atmosalex/atmosalex.github.io/`, then proceed.
5.	Go to the *Settings* tab, then click *Pages* (under *Code and automation*), and check that the *Build and deployment* section looks like this: [![screenshot][3]][3]
6.	If you can see the *Actions* tab, click it and check that the build and deployment action has finished. Once it has, navigate to **[username].github.io** to see your site, which should be a copy of this one! If you cannot see an *Actions* tab, just wait a few minutes then go to your URL to check it is live.

Now you are ready to customize your site! To add your name to the site, go to your Github page, edit `_config.yml`, and replace the temporary title with your name.

[2]: /assets/IMG/instr_import.png

### How to change the theme (optional)
1.	You can choose any theme [listed on this page](https://pages.github.com/themes/), though some do not work as well on mobile devices.
2.	From GitHub, edit `_config.yml` and replace the `theme:` line with `theme: jekyll-theme-name` where `name` is the name of the theme from the above list. **For the `minima` theme, use a shortened preface like so `theme: minima`**, the others seem to need the whole preface `theme: jekyll-theme-`. You can check the *Actions* tab (as in step 6. above) to make sure the site is building successfully.

### How to change your site logo (optional)
1. Some themes, such as `jekyll-theme-minimal`, show a logo. In your repository, upload a logo or profile picture to the `assets/IMG/` directory
2. Open `_config.yml` and modify the line `logo: /assets/IMG/template_logo.png` to point to your new image

## Guide to Adding Content
* Your repository's `README.md` file (the file you are reading now) acts like a home page. Replace its contents with whatever you want the world to see by editing the file on GitHub.
* If you want to turn this page into a CV or blog, etc., it may be useful to refer to a [guide for writing Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
* You can create other markdown files (.md) in your repository and navigate to them from this page using links, i.e.: [here is a link to another file, `project.md`](project.md)
* When editing a markdown file on GitHub, it is useful to wrap text by selecting the *Soft wrap* option as shown: ![screenshot](/assets/IMG/instr_wrap.png)
* If you want to get even more technical, you can also write HTML in your .md files, and GitHub Pages will render it. For example, the image below is displayed by writing the following (edit this file to see!): `<img align="right" width="200" height="200" src="/assets/IMG/template_frog.png">`
<img align="right" width="337" height="200" src="/assets/IMG/template_frog.png">

## Delivering your Project

Your final project is delivered in two components: a report and your code.

### Report

Your report should be **delivered via your website**. Submit a link to your website on BruinLearn so that your instructor can browse it to find your report. 

To make this simple, you can write the report using a word processor or Latex, then export it as a .pdf file and upload it to the `assets` directory. You can then link to it [like so](/assets/project_demo.pdf). However, you can also type the report directly onto the website using another markdown page - [here is](/project.md) a template for that.

### Code

A link to your code must be submitted on BruinLearn, and the course instructor must be able to download your code to mark it. The code could be in a Google Colab notebook (make sure to *share* the notebook so access is set to **Anyone with the link**), or you could upload the code into a separate GitHub repository, or you could upload the code into the `assets` directory of your website and link to it.
